This is a fork of PyGnuplot by Ben Schneider. The project is personal. The goal is to fascilatate easier logging for data and plots for data science related tasks. I do not like to work in a browser, I'd prefere a terminal or a local editor. I prefer logging to a file instead  of a browser prompt. Also plotting should be an easier task, and langauge independent.

Gnuplot usually requires fewer line of code and it's lanuage independnet.
